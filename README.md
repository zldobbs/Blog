# MEAN Blog
Planned implementation of a blog, built from the ground up with the objective
of learning the MEAN stack. Technologies I have little to no experience in will
be explored, including but not limited to:

* node, express
* MongoDB
* angular
* sass
* materialize / foundation?
* socket-io

## Personal Notes
Specific to my implementation of this application. Temporary, but I will refer
to these for the time being. If you are not me reading this, chances are
these will be irrelevant to you since the mongo server is not included within
the repo.

### Launching node server
* Navigate to project dir
* `npm start` or `nodemon`

### Launching local mongo server
* WIP

### Starting mongo shell
Use the mongo shell to manipulate the collections and databases manually

* Navigate to project dir
* `mongo`
