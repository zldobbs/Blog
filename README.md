# Blog
Planned implementation of a blog, built from the ground up. Technologies I have
little to no experience in will be explored, including but not limited to:

* node
* MongoDB
* react / angular
* sass
* materialize / foundation?
* socket-io
* OOP w/ js

## Personal Notes
Specific to my implementation of this application. Temporary, but I will refer
to these for the time being.

### Launching local mongo server
Might be a much easier method, but until you wanna look into it:

* Navigate to mongodb folder within node_modules
* `mongod --dbpath ../../data/db/`

### Starting mongo shell
Use the mongo shell to manipulate the collections and databases manually

* Navigate to project dir
* `mongo`
